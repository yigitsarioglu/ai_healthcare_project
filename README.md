# Second Assignment :  Building a CNN Model

In this assignment you will create a ResNet-18 architecture for binary classification. Step-by step instructions are given in the colab notebook. After completing the assignment, convert your notebook into html format and upload it to moodle

# Third Assignment :  Training the Model

In this assignment you will

* write helper functions
* train the model
* hyperparameter search using W&B

# Fourth Assignment :  Improving the Results

 In this assignment, my focus revolves around enhancing the performance of the model through the exploration and implementation of various techniques. Through this iterative process of analysis and improvement, my objective is to elevate the accuracy of our AI model, fostering a deeper understanding of the intricate interplay between data, model architecture, and optimization strategies.
